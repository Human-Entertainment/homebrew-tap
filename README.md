# Human-Entertainmnet Tap

## What is this for?
This is the official Inuk Entertainment brew tap. All package managers for OS'es officially endorsed by Inuk Entertainmnet has repos to add official support to the OS and also to add missing packages that we use ourself. This brew tap is just that, a repo that adds missing packages like MediBang Paint Pro, as well as our own software.
